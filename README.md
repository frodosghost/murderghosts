## Note

Two years ago I was watching (Strip Search)[http://penny-arcade.com/strip-search] and started following (Alexandra Douglass)[http://www.alexandra-douglass.com] on (twitter)[https://twitter.com/Lexxercise]. On 20th July 2013 she posted about (a dream)[https://twitter.com/Lexxercise/status/358510924564414465] she had and followed up with a (drawing)[https://twitter.com/Lexxercise/status/358509248478597120].

What follows is a short story I wrote with that drawing in mind.

## Introduction

> And it smiled at me sweetly. Like a ghost that had no lower jaw.

> She led me past a gravestone and pointed. Her long finger cast a faint shadow over the place where the grave was dug. "Samantha McDougall". But that was now, before, when it wasn't so cold.
