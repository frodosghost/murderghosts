Murderghosts

And it smiled at me sweetly. Like a ghost that had no lower jaw.
She led me past a gravestone and pointed. Her long finger cast a faint shadow over the place where the grave was dug. "Sarah McDougall".




I don't know how she knew it all, but she did. Sometimes you forget things you should be taking notice of. They slip through the cracks and you end between the worlds. Yet with the outstretched arms and the blistering cold I wasn't thinking. I should have been thinking.

Her long blond hair bouncing as she skipped. A short, old dress that came down to her knees and some spotted socks in t-bar leather school shoes. She smiled sweetly and turned her hair to the side when she was thinking.



A little girl skipped through the peat, her shoes were not very damp. "Watchout for the Murderghosts." Her voice was clear. She stopped and looked at me. "You're pretty."

I furrowed my brow and spoke slowly, "Thanks. I guess." People don't all me pretty, I am driven and focused - definitely not pretty.

"Watchout for the Murderghosts." She said again, a cheery voice in the damp moors.

"Uh." I paused. "Where are your parents?"

"Oh, they are in the castle over there." She pointed to the castle that was upon a a rise not too far away. "That is where his great grandfather used to live. We are on holidays."

"That sounds nice. Holidays in a castle." It did sound nice, if you like the cold.

"Do you know that ghosts can't make a noise. They also cannot touch anything in our world, for they live between worlds. And they want everyone who lives in this world to join theirs. They live between between life and death." She was chirpy as an early morning bird, singing in the clear and bright day. "Would you like to see one?"

"Not really." I said.

"Awwwww. But they are funny." She smiled innocently and tilted her head toward her left shoulder. "I saw one that couldn't smile."

"Where are your parents?"

"They are in the castle. Like I said before." She said, simply. "Would you like to see them?"






"They have Visibles, the Murderghosts do."

"What are Visibles?" I asked. We still walked through the moors, there was a fog coming down as the sun closed in toward the horizon. I should have wondered why she wasn't feeling the cold.

"They are the people the Murderghosts take into the World Between the Worlds. A Visible is like a puppet. I once had a puppet, it was a bunny rabbit, brown with a pink nose. I put it on my hand and scared the cat with it.

"Do you have a puppet?"

"No." I said. "I do have a cat though, his name is Dodger."

"They also have long arms for choking people. Not your cat named Dodger, the Murderghosts." She was so matter-of-fact with what she was saying that I had no questions. I wanted to talk of happier subjects, but she continued.

"They want everyone to join them, in the World Between the Worlds."

"Aren't you cold?"

"I am not cold, I have been skipping. Do you know that you can't feel the cold in the World between the Worlds, but it is cold all the time. 'sunk-in-your-bones' type of cold too."

Too much happy girl talking about creepy things. "What is your name?" I asked, trying to change the subject.

"Alex, but my friends call me Lex." She said.

"And what are you doing here.

She sighed and grunted in frustration. "Like I said, My family and I came for a holiday. My father was born up here near the Rannoch, somewhere in Lochaber. So we came up for holidays."

"Must be nice in a castle. Big beds and huge rooms."

"It's alright, I 'spose. It gets lonely."

"I have come to the Rannoch Moors for my university study I am doing."

"What is Univesity?"

"School." I said and Lex nodded in excitement because she understood. "We are learning how to look after the moors so you can enjoy them when you're older.

. Learning about the conservation of moors were part of my biodiversity course at the London University. I don't even know why I was studying it, I guess I wanted to help eve the environment in some way. Not the time to be pondering this now.

There was a castle on the horizon that we were walking towards. The peat grew thick, it was an ode to the feelings, decayed vegetation think beneath my feet as we walked.



My father wanted to visit the castle where his grand father lived. So we drove in the car - a light yellow Ford, with a broken heater and no radio - we drove for half a day before we got here.

Where are your parents?

Oh, they are in the castle. You will meet them when we get there.

Okay. So you drove all day?

No. We drove for half a day. I was freezing in the back. But my father wouldn't do anything about it.

When we got to the castle we went inside. It was dark and cold. My father took a torch from the wall and lit it with the cigarette lighter from the car. We were lucky he did that. The sun goes down awful early in these parts.

We went inside. My father was excited. He took mother and I around the castle, showing us rooms and hallways. Old paintings and chamber rooms. He loved adventuring in here when he was little, and he loved it even more when he was little. Well, there was one part of the castle that my father forgot about. The Lower Parts.

The peat ended and we walked onto a narrow pathway.

"We're almost there now." She said. "Past the parking area and up the pathway to the front door. The front was built high up to keep invaders away in the early times."

There was no car out the front of the castle. No tire marks in the mud either, I guessed the car was parked around the back. We walked silently up the pathway. The air was chilly and a drew my coat tighter around me and snuggled into the fur around the collar.

The door was huge and wooden. Large metal bands held the panels of timber close together, it looked like a monstrous mouth that consumed everyone who entered. Lex walked through the open the door. I followed her inside, a shiver ran through my body was we stepped across the threshold.

"Take the torch from the wall. I can't hold it." I lifted the torch from the metal bands. Shadows shifted along the walls as I held it I waved my other hand against the light, now that I had control over one of the shadows gave me comfort, less moving without my control.

My mother and father are in the lower parts.

You were telling me about them before.

Was I? Of course I was. You see, I forget things now. The steps are over this way.


You see the Lower Parts was always out of bounds for my father when he was little. He was not allowed to go down there, ever.

Have you been down there?

Of course. He took us down there when we were on holidays." I shone the torch down the bluestone walls, trying to see the bottom of the stair case. "Oh, you won't see the bottom, miss." Lex said. "It's too far away, we will have to walk down to see my parents."

Bluestone steps, heading to the Lower Parts of a castle in the Rannoch Moors, are a scary place to walk. Even with a little girl and a torch. I started thinking about why I was here again, trying to investigate the age of peat upon the moors. Why was I walking with a little girl? Why was I here?

The flames danced from the kerosene torch. Shining on the walls and lighting a few steps in front of where we walked.

Lex whispered now, like her words would break glass. "The Lower Parts are where bad things happened." A few more steps. "Some bad things that happened long ago, and some bad things that were not-so long ago."


The flames dancing on the walls flickers and covered my shaking hands. "Where are your parents, again Lex?"

"Oh, just over here, by the wall." She pointed and I tried to follow her hand through the shadows and dark. I wanted to see her parents. Comfort of human voices. There was some shoes on the edge of the light, so I took a few steps closer towards them.

They were not sleeping, nor were they sitting. Two bodies, old flesh clung to the bones of the long-since dead. I dropped the torch. "My parents died on holidays. They were scared by what they found in the Lower Parts." The light shone against the wall a little less, the flame was starting to flicker out against the cold floor.

"I was scared too. But, it is not so cold anymore. the frost in my bones keeps me warm."

There was something cold around my neck. Long, thin and cold. "This is my friend, Marissa. She was married to my father's great grandfather. She was the first be stuck down here." Through the shadows I could see her drifting upon the air. The Murderghost was not walking. There was a scream from afar, it sounded like it was from another world.

And then, I could not feel the cold anymore.




It was not cold anymore.




 and thin. I turned and saw faintly through the dark










I was in the Rannoch Moors last Novemeber for a research project.


Scared stiff. Frozen solid. Cannot more. Paralised by fear. There we go. Fear takes hold. Nowhere to  ove and everything happens in slow motion.

The ghost was dark and light against the shadows. Long arms and long thin fingers. It had no jaw and drifted in an eerie motion across the room. The light flicked out, the shadows lengthen on the walls. The hands were cold and long and thin against my throat.

And then I couldn't feel the cold.

Murderghosts can only use Visibles of the people they have taken to the World between the Worlds. If they take you there they can use you like a puppet in the world.


And the long arms are for choking people. They want everyone to join them, in the World Between the Worlds. You can't feel the cold, in the World between the Worlds, but it is cold all the time. "Sunk in your bones" type of cold too.
